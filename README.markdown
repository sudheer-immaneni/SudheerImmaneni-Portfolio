# Sudheer Immaneni's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my expertise as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist, with a focus on data engineering, machine learning, and web development. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this portfolio highlights my professional experience, academic projects, and technical skills.

## About Me

I am a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience in designing and managing data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and PySpark, specializing in ETL, data transformation, and performance optimization for large-scale datasets. I am skilled in SQL, Spark SQL, and cloud data solutions to enable real-time analytics. I recently graduated with a Master's in Data Science (May 2025) from the University of Memphis, enhancing my expertise in machine learning, advanced analytics, and financial modeling. My work bridges cloud-based data engineering with data-driven decision-making to deliver impactful business solutions.
